# Resource error

This is used to return status information after an error with a dependent resource.  It is safe to retry after a short delay.


## Problem Type

type = https://problem.api.bunnings.com.au?type=resourceError

## Specification

The resource error is based on the base [RFC 7807](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) problem. This is extended to include code/description collection
